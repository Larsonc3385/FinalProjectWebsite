            <td><h3>Hello, I am Rezmund! I have been creating content on my channel for a little over a 
                year and a half now and have been enjoying every bit of it! I mainly post videos of me
                playing vr games and speedrunning. My favorite game I play for vr is called Rec room. I 
                started playing it when I was in my senior year of highschool when my good friend who also
                plays it on youtube got me hooked on it showing me different tricks, playing different games
                even trying to make one. From there I decided to take it to youtube to share the fun and exciting
                moments I have playing it with the world. In my free time I like to hang out with friends playing 
                video games or trading card games like Magic the Gathering and Yu-Gi-Oh. Feel free to check out my videos 
                under the videos catagory or click the link right
